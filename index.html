<p>I have always been a math minded person as well as a tinkerer. Legos, puzzles, and algebra were some of my favorite things growing up. When it came time to pick a major for college, engineering seemed like a no brainer. I've always loved space, so in particular aerospace engineering seemed like it would be the coolest. </p>

<p>About halfway through my college career I improperly planned my schedule for the semester, leaving a crucial class out of the mix. This class was a prerequisite to many of the next semesters classes which I now would have to delay taking until future semesters. I decided to use my spare time from those delayed classes to start taking classes for a minor in computer science. Immediately I fell in love with programming. I found myself more engaged in my programming projects than I had ever been in my aerospace projects.</p>

<p>Fast forward a couple years and I landed my first internship and it was as a software developer. I spent my summer working full time at <a href="https://www.ipreo.com">Ipreo</a> fixing bugs, creating UI components, and learning the ropes of BD Advanced, a web app used by the financial services industry to make their jobs more efficient. As the summer winded to an end the thought of going back to school hung dauntingly over my head. I had never been this passionate about the work I'd done, and I didn't look forward to stopping. Fortunately, my manager saw that passion and made sure I had an offer for a part time position during the school year. I took the offer without question.</p>

<p>My interest in programming has only gotten deeper in the past few years. I now find myself fascinated by complex algorithms as well as data visualizations to back them up. I am endlessly excited for the career that lies ahead of me and the interesting people I will meet. The world of programming seems infinite to me. Only time will tell where it leads me.</p>
